# HW9
For this assignment, you will use HW 8 as a starting point.  Maintain both assignments 8 & 9 going forward, DO NOT delete HW8.  The page should be called index.html.

1.	Execute the script only after the document loads, using $(document).ready().
2.	Change all CSS selectors to use the jQuery equivalent.
3.	Add a Button with text “Spin Again” and a light green background. Use jQuery so when a user hovers the mouse over the button it displays “SPIN NOW” in a bigger font and a dark green background.
4.	Add an event handler for page unload via jQuery.  When fired, all elements will fadeout(2000) and text “Goodbye” will fadein(2000).
